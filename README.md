# cybersecurity
developing a vulnerable website to practice XSS and SQL injection, then we will implement cybersecurity methods to protect the website 
using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, MYSQL

the goal from this project is to understand how the vulnerable websites can be exploited, and how it is important to develop a 
web application with the SSDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle) which it is a framework incorporates security throughout the development process

to run this project firstly you should have the MYSQL database and navigate to file:
backend -> config -> db.js and replace with your user and password in the database : root, password,database

then install the requirement packages: 
npm install express body-parser bcrypt mysql cors nodemailer jsonwebtoken crypto


then navigate to the backend:
cd backend


to run the server side:
node app.js



and open the file: backend -> public -> Login_page -> index.html and open this page to start the interaction with server side
